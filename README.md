## Development Notes

1)When I compare the contents of websites, I notice that most websites are using some sort of dynamic variables and attribute names based on the currentDate to protect themselves from XSS attacks. This situation causes the contentHasChanged variable to always return true. In order to minimize this issue, I installed the Cheerio npm package to exclude style and script tags, as well as attribute names. The code now only includes the HTML content within the <body> tags. Please keep in mind that this makes the comparison less strict, so if there are any changes to the design of the website, the code may not detect them since it excludes style tags.

However, you can always revert this by modifying the code in the compare function, removing the htmlSimplifier around the currentContent, as well as the cachedContent on lines 83-84.

2)Since TWILIO API costs me credits(real money $🙈), I usually comment out the SMS_Sending function in Services.js line 103-106. Please make sure it is commented in.

3)When it runs for the first time, it will not display the spreadsheet data nor send any notifications, as there is no cached data to show.
